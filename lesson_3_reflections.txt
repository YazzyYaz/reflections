When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are using another computer and want to access the repository, it's much easier to have it remote so that you
don't need to be on the same computer to access it. Also, let's say you are working with other collaboraters on a 
large project, having access and using a remote repository is much more convenient since everyone can have access to 
it wherever they are and start making changes to it.
